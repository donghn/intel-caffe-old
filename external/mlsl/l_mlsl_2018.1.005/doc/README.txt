Introduction
------------

Intel(R) Machine Learning Scaling Library (Intel(R) MLSL) is a library providing
an efficient implementation of communication patterns used in deep learning.

    - Built on top of MPI, allows for use of other communication libraries
    - Optimized to drive scalability of communication patterns
    - Works across various interconnects: Intel(R) Omni-Path Architecture,
      InfiniBand*, and Ethernet
    - Common API to support Deep Learning frameworks (Caffe*, Theano*,
      Torch*, etc.)

Intel(R) MLSL package comprises the Intel MLSL Software Development Kit (SDK)
and the Intel(R) MPI Library Runtime components.

----------------------------------------------------
Installing Intel(R) Machine Learning Scaling Library
----------------------------------------------------

I.   Installing Intel(R) MLSL using RPM Package Manager (root mode):

        1. Log in as root.

        2. Install the package:
            $ rpm -i intel-mlsl-devel-64-<version>.<update>-<package#>.x86_64.rpm

            where <version>.<update>-<package#> is a string, such as: 2017.0-009

     To uninstall Intel(R) MLSL, use the command:
     $ rpm -e intel-mlsl-devel-64-<version>.<update>-<package#>.x86_64

II.  Installing Intel(R) MLSL using install.sh (user mode):

     Run install.sh and follow the instructions.

     There is no uninstall script. To uninstall Intel(R) MLSL, delete the entire
     directory where you have installed the package.

Directory Structure
-------------------

Following a successful installation, the files associated with the Intel(R) MLSL
are installed on your host system. The following directory map indicates the 
default structure and identifies the file types stored in each sub-directory:

`-- opt
    `-- intel        Common directory for Intel(R) Software Development Products.
            `-- mlsl_<version>.<update>.<package#>

Intel's compilers may or may not optimize to the same degree for non-Intel
microprocessors for optimizations that are not unique to Intel microprocessors.
These optimizations include SSE2, SSE3, and SSSE3 instruction sets and other
optimizations. Intel does not guarantee the availability, functionality, or
effectiveness of any optimization on microprocessors not manufactured by Intel.
Microprocessor-dependent optimizations in this product are intended for use
